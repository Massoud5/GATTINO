# GATTINO Grocery

## Context:

    Creating a Website that allow the admin(the grocery owner) to publish her grocery services and to sale her products online without delivery.
    The user or customer won't have an account but he/she can get informed about the store, proposed services and different products.
    In the Website, the user can also order products, gift packages and plates and pay it online with a visa card or mastercard. A bill of order will be sent to the user and admin. Then the command can be retrieved in the store. 
    The customer can be a company and have a big command so orders should be sent at least 24 hours before retrieval time.
    The Website should be fonctional with a standard UX conception.
